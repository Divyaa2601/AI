# 📘 **Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Networks (MNIST)**

This project demonstrates handwritten digit classification using the **MNIST dataset** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with PyTorch.
The model learns to recognize digits (0–9) and visualizes predictions along with training curves.

This project is inspired by sample neural-network notebooks but uses a **CNN**, making it more robust and unique while staying close to the original structure.
